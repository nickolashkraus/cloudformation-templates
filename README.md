A collection of CloudFormation templates.

Each directory has it's own `README.md` with documentation on deploying the CloudFormation stack.

⚠️**Warning**: As of January 2020, I am no longer adding to this repository, as I believe [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) will be the preferred technology for declarative infrastructure moving forward. That said, if you need assistance with any of these CloudFormation stacks, simply open an [issue](https://github.com/nickolashkraus/cloudformation-templates/issues).

**Update**: Almost five years later, I've had to change my stance slightly on the above assertion. For new AWS resources (e.g., [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock)), Terraform has not been able to create the corresponding resources fast enough for it to be a viable replacement.
